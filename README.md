# About this project

Epitome is a discord bot running on a Raspberry Pi to track RSS feeds, parse and filter them through chosen tags. It is meant to be used by different discord servers (guilds) and offer per-channel configurations. Epitome is written in Typescript upon the [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/) library.

## Background

This bot was developed in order to help feminist collectives gather & filter newspaper / media articles & stories in the process of giving true insights about sexism, feminicide and other forms of violence against women & gender minority groups. The process, if done manually, is tedious, time-consuming and emotionally draining. Collectives and activists using discord as a communication tool can now use this bot to automate some aspects of their watch work.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

Create your own version of the bot by following the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) instructions. You should end up with a bot token and a client ID. Don't forget to add your bot to your server with a generated invitation link.

You will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) installed on your machine.

### Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:sparky-raccoon/epitome.git
cd epitome
yarn install
```

Then, create a `.env` file at the root of the project and add the following environment variables:

```bash
TOKEN_DEV=your-bot-token
CLIENT_ID_DEV=your-client-id
```

### Usage

Run the following to deploy the slash commands and start the bot locally.

```bash
yarn deploy-command-dev
yarn dev
```

This will create a database.dev.sqlite file in the root of the project. You can use [DB Browser for SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org/) to open it and inspect the database.

You are now set up to test the bot locally.

### Deployment

The bot is meant to be deployed on a Raspberry Pi using Github Actions. The workflow file can be found in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`. You will need to add the following secrets to your repository:

- `TOKEN` : your bot token
- `CLIENT_ID` : your client ID

The Raspberry Pi itself must be configured as a self-hosted runner to listen to code changes. It should have [pm2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/) installed to run the bot as a service.
Please refer to the [Github Actions documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners) for more information.
